          <h2>About Checkmate </h2>
          <p class="about-text">Checkmate Pharma is developing a new approach for cancer immunotherapy, activating the immune system in a specific manner to recognize and kill tumor cells throughout the body, without harming normal tissues. </p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="row">
        <div class="col-md-4 col-s-12">
          <h3>The immuno-oncology revolution</h3>
          <p>Certain immune cells called “killer T cells” are able to destroy cancer cells, yet in most cancer patients they fail to do this effectively.  For decades scientists and physicians have tried to activate these immune cells to reject cancer, mostly with little success.  It is now known that most tumors use “immune checkpoint proteins” that switch off the killer T cells before they can destroy the tumor.  This discovery of immune checkpoints has led to the development of several “checkpoint inhibitors” including for example pembrolizumab and nivolumab, both of which block the PD-1 checkpoint.  These and other checkpoint inhibitors have ignited a potential revolution in cancer therapy, because about 15-30% of patients with many different types of advanced cancer have had excellent responses to this therapy.</p> 
        </div>
        <div class="col-md-4 col-s-12">
          <h3>Why do so few patients respond to checkpoint inhibitors?</h3>
          <p>If a cancer patients’ immune system has already been activated and is poised to kill their tumor, then treatment with a checkpoint inhibitor can release the immune system, allowing it to destroy the tumor (see example <a href="http://www.npr.org/blogs/health/2015/02/09/373292216/harnessing-the- immune-system-to-fight-cancer" target="blank">here</a>). Unfortunately in most cancer patients the immune system is not already activated to kill the tumor, and so treatment with the checkpoint inhibitor does not provide any benefit and may cause significant toxicity. The checkpoint inhibitor essentially takes the brakes off the immune system, but does not tell it where to go or what to do.</p> 
        </div>
        <div class="col-md-4 col-s-12">
          <h3>How can the response to checkpoint inhibitors be improved?</h3>
          <p>Many scientists believe that the response to checkpoint inhibitors would be dramatically increased if combined with an immune activator to stimulate an killer T cell attack against the tumor.  Many different immune activators have been tested in animals and humans, and the one that has so far been the strongest at activating anti-tumor killer T cells is called CpG DNA.  Checkmate’s founder and CEO, Dr. Art Krieg, discovered CpG DNA in 1994.  Since then several different CpG DNAs have been administered to thousands of humans showing strong immune activation and an excellent safety profile.   By itself, CpG rarely triggers the immune system to reject cancer – we believe that it needs to be combined with a checkpoint inhibitor to release the immune brakes at the same time as the CpG activates it.  Checkmate intends to pursue this approach in cancer therapy.</p>

          <p class="bio krieg">Art Krieg, Checkmate’s founder and CEO, has worked in the oligonucleotide field since the 1980s.  After discovering immune stimulatory CpG DNA in 1994, he co-founded Coley Pharmaceutical Group in 1997 to develop the technology, discovering and taking 4 novel CpG oligonucleotides into clinical development.  In 2008 Pfizer acquired Coley and Art became Chief Scientific Officer of Pfizer’s Oligonucleotide Therapeutics Unit until they exited the field in 2011. Art subsequently co-founded RaNA Therapeutics, serving as its CEO through 2013, and served as CSO at Sarepta Therapeutics until July, 2014. He co-founded the first antisense journal, Nucleic Acid Therapeutics, and the Oligonucleotide Therapeutic Society, for which he is currently President-elect. Art received an MD from Washington University and trained in internal medicine at the University of Minnesota and rheumatology at the NIH before joining the faculty at the University of Iowa, becoming professor of internal medicine. He has published more than 250 scientific papers and is an inventor on 48 issued US patents covering oligonucleotide technologies.
