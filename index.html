          <h2>About Checkmate </h2>
          <p class="about-text">Checkmate Pharma is developing a new approach for cancer immunotherapy, activating the immune system in a specific manner to recognize and kill tumor cells throughout the body, without harming normal tissues. </p>
        </div>

        <div class="col-md-4 col-s-12">
          <h3>The immuno-oncology revolution</h3>
          <p class="first-info-about">Certain immune cells called “killer T cells” are able to destroy cancer cells, yet in most cancer patients they fail to do this effectively.  For decades scientists and physicians have tried to activate these immune cells to reject cancer, mostly with little success.  It is now known that most tumors use “immune checkpoint proteins” that switch off the killer T cells before they can destroy the tumor.  This discovery of immune checkpoints has led to the development of several “checkpoint inhibitors” including for example pembrolizumab and nivolumab, both of which block the PD-1 checkpoint.  These and other checkpoint inhibitors have ignited a potential revolution in cancer therapy, because about 15-30% of patients with many different types of advanced cancer have had excellent responses to this therapy.</p> 
        </div>
        <div class="col-md-4 col-s-12">
          <h3>Why do so few patients respond to checkpoint inhibitors?</h3>
          <p class="first-info-about">If a cancer patients’ immune system has already been activated and is poised to kill their tumor, then treatment with a checkpoint inhibitor can release the immune system, allowing it to destroy the tumor (see example <a target="blank" href="http://www.npr.org/blogs/health/2015/02/09/373292216/harnessing-the- immune-system-to-fight-cancer">here</a>). Unfortunately in most cancer patients the immune system is not already activated to kill the tumor, and so treatment with the checkpoint inhibitor does not provide any benefit and may cause significant toxicity. The checkpoint inhibitor essentially takes the brakes off the immune system, but does not tell it where to go or what to do.</p> 
        </div>
        <div class="col-md-4 col-s-12">
          <h3>How can the response to checkpoint inhibitors be improved?</h3>
          <p class="first-info-about">Many scientists believe that the response to checkpoint inhibitors would be dramatically increased if combined with an immune activator to stimulate an killer T cell attack against the tumor.  Many different immune activators have been tested in animals and humans, and the one that has so far been the strongest at activating anti-tumor killer T cells is called CpG DNA.  Checkmate’s founder and CEO, Dr. Art Krieg, discovered CpG DNA in 1994.  Since then several different CpG DNAs have been administered to thousands of humans showing strong immune activation and an excellent safety profile.   By itself, CpG rarely triggers the immune system to reject cancer – we believe that it needs to be combined with a checkpoint inhibitor to release the immune brakes at the same time as the CpG activates it.  Checkmate intends to pursue this approach in cancer therapy.</p>

            <h3 class="description-header-1">Tumors normally prevent T cell activation </h3>
            <p class="second-info-about">Cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) have the potential to kill tumor cells but normally do not because i) they do not receive adequate levels of the three required stimulatory signals; and/or ii) they are arrested by inhibitory signals or “checkpoints” that turn them off (e.g. through PD-1 and CTLA-4).   In order to be fully activated and kill tumor cells, CTL must receive three stimulatory signals from a dendritic cell (DC):  1) a tumor antigen must be “presented” to the T cell receptor (TCR); 2) “costimulation” must be provided through CD28 on the T cell; and 3) type I interferons (IFN) must stimulate the DC and T cells through the type I IFN receptor (IFNα/βR).  Successful tumors capable of immune evasion can prevent the CTL response by recruiting immature plasmacytoid DC (pDC) that provide only weak stimulatory signals (indicated by the small “+” signs), and promote dominant  inhibitory effects (indicated by the larger “-“ signs) through the “checkpoint” molecules CTLA-4 and PD-L1. Thus successful tumors induce an environment in which the “-“ signals to CTL dominate over the “+” signals needed to kill the tumors.</p>

            <h3 class="description-header-2">CpG activates plasmacytoid DC, inducing CTL and tumor rejection in combination with anti-PD-1 </h3>
            <p class="second-info-about">Checkmate’s CpG DNA is the strongest stimulus known for pDC, acting through the endosomal Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9) to provide all three of the stimulatory signals (green “+” signs) required to induce a maximal anti-tumor CTL response.  TLR9 signaling secondarily induces expression of the PD-1 checkpoint on T cells, which normally inhibits them.  However, in the presence of a checkpoint inhibitor antibody to either PD-1 (shown) or to PD-L1 (not shown) the fully activated T cells release cytotoxic factors such as perforins and granzymes (granules in T cell) that act to effectively eliminate the tumor cells. Combining a CpG DNA with a checkpoint inhibitor will lead to an environment that has a dominant “+” effect thus leading to tumor eradication by the CTLs.</p>
